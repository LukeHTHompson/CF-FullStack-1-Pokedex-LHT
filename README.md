# CF-FullStack-1-Pokedex-LHT

This project was to supply a searchable list of Pokemon. This list provides links to modals which offer more information about each Pokemon: Name, Type(s), Height, and In-Game Sprite.

Barring any JavaScript download issues, the project will run properly upon opening the homepage.

The Pokemon information was pulled from API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=898
